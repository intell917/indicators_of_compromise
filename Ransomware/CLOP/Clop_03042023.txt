In 2019, Cl0p Ransomware surfaced as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and became notorious due to its advanced techniques. 
Its main target was larger organizations with an annual income of USD 5 million or higher. They have attacked more than 100 companies 
since January 2023. Security researchers have discovered that Cl0p is now targeting Linux systems, using a new variant specifically designed 
for this operating system.
